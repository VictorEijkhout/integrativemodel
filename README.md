# The Integrative Model for Parallelism

This is a project for a unifying (meaning: MPI, OpenMP, Cuda, whatever) model
for parallelism.

The software is in a pre-alpha state since I decided on a complete
rewrite of the previous working-but-very-messy version.

If you are interested, read some of the reports and then
contact me:
