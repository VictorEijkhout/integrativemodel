The Integrative Model for Parallelism (IMP) is normally described
in terms of distributions. However, this assumes an `owner-computes' model
of parallel computing. There is a more theory of IMP,
from which the distribution formulation follows easily.

Here we present the deep theory of IMP. This is only for afficionados.
