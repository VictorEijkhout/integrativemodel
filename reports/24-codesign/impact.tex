Our research is of intellectual interest in that it rethinks a number
of long-held notions regarding software and hardware. However, our
ideas can have a number of far-ranging practical benefits:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \ac{IMP} model by itself offers a global expression of
  parallelism, thereby making parallel programming more productive and
  more accessible. This claim has of course been made many times
  before. In our case, however, we have
  shown~\cite{Eijkhout:hips2014} how algorithms in our
  model can be translated to efficient code in a number of lower level
  programming systems such as \ac{MPI} and \ac{CnC}.
\item Current hardware design can not be extrapolated to future
  computing needs other than at prohibitive cost.  By dealing with performance
  issues at an architectural level (rather than by ``brute force''), hardware based 
  on our proposed approach should allow considerable reductions in design and 
  fabrication cost, more efficient hardware utilization and scalability, and significantly
  improved energy efficiency.
\end{itemize}
