\subsection{Outline}
The rest of this proposal is structured as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item In section~\ref{sec:diagnosis} we give a relatively detailed
  diagnosis of the impact of current architectural shortcomings.
\item Section~\ref{sec:sketch} will then briefly outline why we
  advocate a co-design effort for addressing these problems.
\item Section~\ref{sec:imp} gives a short introduction to the IMP
  programming model that we will use to provide the semantics for
  our redesigned hardware.
\item Section~\ref{sec:proposed} outlines in detail the research we
  will undertake, and section~\ref{sec:eval} states how we will
  evaluate the success of our endeavour.
\item Finally, we address the educational component in
  section~\ref{sec:edu}; we give a timeline and deliverables in
  section~\ref{sec:time}, and give relevant results from prior
  research in section~\ref{sec:prior}.
\end{itemize}
